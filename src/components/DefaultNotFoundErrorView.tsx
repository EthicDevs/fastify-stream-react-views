            This error happens when a view has been requested but it has not
            been found in your config's specified `viewFolder`.

          <p>
            Check that the file you are trying to render `reply.streamReactView()`
            actually exists on disk and that it correctly export default a React
            component of type `ReactIsland` and it is named the same as the file.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that still does not work, check the `app.manifest.json` file to
            see if the view was detected, if not, please open a bug on our repo.
